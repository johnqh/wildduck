  - Rate limiting and WebSockets documentation

### 6. Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- **Location**: `/docs/adrs/`
- **Documents Created**:
  - `001-blockchain-authentication.md`: Web3 authentication system
  - `002-mongodb-storage-architecture.md`: Document-based storage design
  - `003-stateless-protocol-servers.md`: Horizontal scaling architecture

### 7. Code Usage Patterns and Examples
- **Location**: `/docs/examples/api-usage-patterns.md`
- **Content**:
  - Practical implementation examples
  - Authentication patterns for EVM and Solana
  - User management workflows
  - Message handling patterns
  - Advanced search and filtering
  - Error handling and retry logic

### 8. Inline Algorithm Comments
- **Enhanced**: Complex address resolution algorithm in `user-handler.js`
- **Improvements**:
  - Step-by-step explanation of address lookup process
  - Detailed wildcard matching logic documentation
